**Difficulty:** Medium  
[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-almost-palindromic-substring/)

---

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters.

A substring is **almost-palindromic** if it becomes a palindrome after removing **exactly** one character from it.

Return an integer denoting the length of the **longest** **almost-palindromic** substring in `s`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abca"

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

Choose the substring `"**abca**"`.

- Remove `"ab**c**a"`.
- The string becomes `"aba"`, which is a palindrome.
- Therefore, `"abca"` is almost-palindromic.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "abba"

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

Choose the substring `"**abba**"`.

- Remove `"a**b**ba"`.
- The string becomes `"aba"`, which is a palindrome.
- Therefore, `"abba"` is almost-palindromic.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "zzabba"

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:**

Choose the substring `"z**zabba**"`.

- Remove `"**z**abba"`.
- The string becomes `"abba"`, which is a palindrome.
- Therefore, `"zabba"` is almost-palindromic.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= s.length <= 2500`
- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
